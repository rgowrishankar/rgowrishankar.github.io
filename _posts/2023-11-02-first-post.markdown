# Hello Hello!

As a developer navigating the ever-changing landscape of Software Development, I decided to try to pull myself by my boots, buckle down, batten down the hatches, ignore the piling house work (only for a bit) and start a series of pages and blog posts.


I hope to share my experiences, learn a bunch of things and also create some useful content for others. 

That's all for now!
